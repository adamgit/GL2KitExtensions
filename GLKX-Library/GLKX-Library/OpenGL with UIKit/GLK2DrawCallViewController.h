/**
 Introduced in: Refactoring-1 (approximately Part 7)
 
 Extension of Apple's GLKViewController that adds support for the
 GLK2DrawCall class. OpenGL revolves around Draw calls!
 
 This class implements the basic OpenGL rendering loop, layered on
 top of Apple's GLKViewController built-in loop:
 
 0. GENERAL: integrates correctly with viewDidLoad etc, as per Apple docs
 1. SETUP: create and set a valid EAGLContext, or crash/error
 2. SETUP: generate a set of "initial Draw calls" (or none)
 3. LOOP FOREVER: render a single "frame" to the screen
 
 The "frame" doesn't exist in OpenGL, strictly speaking, but it's a
 useful concept. To render a frame, we split it up like this:
 
 3a. EACH FRAME: callback for subclasses to know a new frame is starting
 3b. EACH FRAME: request a sorted list of Draw calls to render
 3c. EACH FRAME LOOP: for each Draw call:
   3c-i. update all GL state
   3c-ii. update all shader-uniforms
   3c-iii. render that Draw call
   3c-iv. reset state as required
 
 OpenGL ES 2 has approximately 15 different pieces of "high-level"
 render-state; to render a single Draw call, all of them have to be
 turned on, or off, and configured, or reset, or re-allocated, or
 re-uploaded (e.g. texture maps). Hence the "for each Draw call"
 above is a lot of boilerplate code.
 
 IMPORTANT NOTE:
 
 This class is incomplete; it only handles the bits of GL state that have
 been covered by the tutorials already posted to http://t-machine.org - anything
 not yet written about will need to be added by hand if you use this class.
